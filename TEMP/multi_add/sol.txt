if you translate increment code to assembly it's pseudocode will be like:

1-mov ax,mem[c]
2-inc ax
3-mov mem[c],ax

if we have 2 thread consider this scenario:

thread 1: line 1
thread 2: line (1-2-3) for 99 times
thread 1: line (2-3)
thread 2: line 1
thread 1: line (1-2-3) for remaining 99 times
thread 2: line (2-3) fro the last time

now the value of c is 2 so minimum is 2
